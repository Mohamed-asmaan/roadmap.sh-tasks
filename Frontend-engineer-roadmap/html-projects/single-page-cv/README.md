# Single-Page CV (HTML Only)

This project is part of the **Frontend Engineer Roadmap** and focuses on building a **single-page CV using only HTML**.

The goal is to practice writing **clean, semantic HTML** while structuring real-world content such as education, skills, and work experience. Styling is intentionally kept minimal and will be addressed in a later project.
