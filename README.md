# roadmap.sh-tasks

This repository contains practice projects completed while following the
[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) **Frontend Engineer roadmap**.

The goal of this repository is to track my progress, strengthen fundamentals,
and build small, focused projects as I move through different topics in the
roadmap (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond).


## 📁 Folder Structure


Frontend-engineer-roadmap/
├── html-projects/
│   └── single-page-cv/
│       └── index.html


Each folder represents a specific roadmap section and contains the
corresponding practice tasks or projects.

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects

Most projects are simple frontend exercises.

* Open the project folder
* Open the `index.html` file in a browser

No build tools or setup required unless mentioned inside a project folder.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Practice core frontend concepts
* Follow a structured learning path
* Maintain a public learning log
* Improve code quality and consistency over time

## 📌 Notes

add projects related to CSS, JavaScript, and other frontend topics.
